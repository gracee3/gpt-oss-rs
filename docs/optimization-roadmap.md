# gpt-oss-rs Optimization Roadmap

## Current State (March 28, 2026)

Verified coherent: **8,578 tok/s** peak on A100 80GB SXM4, Qwen2.5-1.5B, FP16, greedy decoding.

### Throughput Scaling Curve (A100 80GB, 32 tok/req)

```
N=1:    101 tok/s    -- single request, latency-bound
N=16:   697 tok/s    -- GPU severely underutilized
N=32:   925 tok/s    -- still underutilized
N=64:   4,063 tok/s  -- inflection point, GPU starts saturating
N=128:  6,360 tok/s  -- production sweet spot
N=256:  8,316 tok/s  -- approaching peak
N=512:  8,528 tok/s  -- near peak
N=768:  8,539 tok/s  -- plateau
N=1024: 8,578 tok/s  -- peak
```

### Python vLLM 0.18 Comparison (same hardware)

```
N=1:    69 tok/s     -- gpt-oss-rs 1.5x faster
N=64:   3,828 tok/s  -- gpt-oss-rs 1.06x faster
N=128:  6,400 tok/s  -- roughly matched
N=256:  9,437 tok/s  -- vLLM 1.13x faster
N=512:  10,771 tok/s -- vLLM 1.26x faster
N=1024: 12,740 tok/s -- vLLM 1.49x faster
```

## Bottleneck Analysis by Batch Size Region

### Region 1: N=1 to N=32 (Latency-Bound)

**Observed:** 101-925 tok/s. Linear scaling with N but far below GPU capacity.

**Bottleneck:** GPU SM underutilization. At N=1, a cuBLAS hgemm for Q projection (shape [1, 1536] x [1536, 1536]) produces only 12 output tiles (128x128 each). An A100 has 108 SMs. Only 11% of the GPU is working. K/V projections ([1, 256]) produce just 2 tiles -- 2% utilization.

**What would help:**
- **cublasLt with split-K** (ready, behind feature flag). Split the K dimension across multiple thread blocks to create more parallelism. Expected: 20-40% gain at N=1, tapering to 0% at N=64+. Implementation exists in `cublaslt_ops.rs`, needs wiring into the forward path.
- **Persistent GEMM kernels.** Instead of launching a new kernel per GEMM, keep thread blocks resident and feed them work via global memory queues. Eliminates kernel launch overhead (~10us per launch x 7 GEMMs x 28 layers = ~2ms per step).
- **Speculative decoding.** Draft model generates K=4-8 candidate tokens, target verifies in one forward pass. Multiplies effective throughput by acceptance rate. Scaffolded in `crates/gpt-oss-speculative/` but not wired.

### Region 2: N=32 to N=64 (Inflection Zone)

**Observed:** 925 to 4,063 tok/s. A 4.4x jump between N=32 and N=64.

**Bottleneck:** The sharp inflection suggests a threshold effect -- likely CUDA graph capture kicking in at a specific padded batch size, or the continuous batching scheduler switching from prefill-dominated to decode-dominated batching.

**What would help:**
- **Profile with GPT_OSS_RS_PROFILE=1** (implemented) to identify exactly where time is spent at N=32 vs N=64. The profiling infrastructure records CUDA events around each phase (HtoD, embedding, per-layer norm/QKV/attention/MLP, LM head, DtoH).
- **Fix CUDA graph capture/replay** (reverted due to coherency bug). The graph agent's implementation replayed with stale metadata. A correct implementation would update input buffer contents in-place before replay, not re-record. This alone could smooth the inflection and add 10-20% across all N.
- **Fused QKV projection** (3 GEMMs -> 1). Agent wrote the code but it wasn't merged into gpu_layer.rs. The weight concatenation is cached after first call. Reduces kernel launches by 2 per layer.
- **Fused gate+up projection** (2 GEMMs -> 1). Same pattern. Reduces kernel launches by 1 per layer.

### Region 3: N=64 to N=256 (Scaling Region)

**Observed:** 4,063 to 8,316 tok/s. Healthy scaling, GPU becoming well-utilized.

**Bottleneck:** Memory bandwidth for weight reads. At N=128, each decode step reads all 2.5GB of model weights (FP16) from HBM. A100 HBM bandwidth is 2 TB/s. Reading 2.5GB takes ~1.25ms. With 128 tokens produced per step, that's 128/1.25ms = 102,400 tok/s theoretical peak. We achieve 6,360 -- only 6.2% of theoretical. The gap is: attention KV cache reads, activation memory traffic, kernel launch overhead, CPU scheduling time, and PCIe transfers.

**What would help:**
- **FP8 weights** (E4M3). Halves weight bandwidth from 2.5GB to 1.25GB per step. cuBLAS FP8 GEMM via cublasLtMatmul. Existing `fp8_kv.cu` kernel handles FP8 KV cache. Expected: 30-60% throughput gain in this region.
- **Async weight prefetch.** Use `cudaMemPrefetchAsync` or L2 pinning (`cudaAccessPolicyWindow`) to prefetch layer N+1's weights while layer N computes. A100 L2 is 40MB; Qwen2.5-1.5B layer weights are ~90MB so partial prefetch helps.
- **FlashDecoding (split-KV parallelism).** With 32-token context (our benchmark), split-KV has minimal benefit. But at 512-4096 token contexts (real production), splitting KV across multiple thread blocks provides 1.5-5x attention speedup. Kernels exist in `split_kv_attention.cu` but wiring had a bug (kernel args mismatch) -- needs careful re-integration.

### Region 4: N=256 to N=1024 (Plateau)

**Observed:** 8,316 to 8,578 tok/s. Nearly flat. This is the compute ceiling.

**Bottleneck:** cuBLAS GEMM throughput. At N=1024, the GEMMs are large enough to fully saturate the GPU's tensor cores. The remaining gap vs vLLM (8,578 vs 12,740 = 0.67x) is pure kernel efficiency.

**What would help:**
- **CuTE/CUTLASS attention kernels.** The current FA2 decode kernel uses scalar FMA for QK dot products, leaving A100's 312 TFLOPS of FP16 tensor cores completely unused. Rewriting with CuTE MMA atoms (`SM80_16x8x16_F32F16F16F32`) would route attention through tensor cores. Expected: 1.3-1.5x for the attention phase.
- **F16 shared memory in attention.** Current kernel promotes f16 KV cache to f32 in shared memory, doubling smem usage (64KB vs 32KB per tile). Keeping f16 in smem halves memory pressure and improves occupancy.
- **cp.async for overlapped KV loads.** Current kernel loads KV tiles synchronously. `cp.async` (sm_80+) enables loading tile N+1 while computing on tile N.
- **Warp-specialized attention.** Separate producer warps (load KV) from consumer warps (compute). Overlaps memory latency with compute within a single thread block. Works on sm_80 via `cp.async` + named barriers.
- **GQA-optimized attention.** Qwen2.5-1.5B has 12 query heads sharing 2 KV heads (6:1 ratio). Current kernel loads KV 6 times for the same 2 KV heads. A GQA-aware kernel loads KV once and processes all 6 query heads, reducing KV bandwidth by 6x.

## Theoretical Peak Analysis

### A100 80GB, Qwen2.5-1.5B FP16

- **Model weights:** 3 GB (FP16)
- **HBM bandwidth:** 2,039 GB/s
- **Weight read time per step:** 3 GB / 2039 GB/s = 1.47 ms
- **Tokens per step at N=1024:** 1024
- **Theoretical peak (weight-bandwidth-bound):** 1024 / 1.47ms = **696,600 tok/s**
- **Current achieved:** 8,578 tok/s = **1.2% of theoretical**

The massive gap between theoretical and achieved comes from:
1. KV cache reads (~0.5-2 GB depending on context length)
2. Activation intermediates (read/write per layer)
3. Kernel launch overhead (~28 layers x ~9 kernels = 252 launches)
4. CPU scheduling time
5. PCIe metadata transfers
6. Softmax, norm, activation kernel time (non-GEMM compute)

### Realistic Target

With all Tier 1-2 optimizations:
- CUDA graphs eliminate kernel launch overhead: +15%
- Fused GEMMs reduce launches by 40%: +5%
- GQA-aware attention: +15%
- CuTE tensor cores for attention: +20%
- cublasLt split-K at low N: +20% (low N only)

Conservative combined: **8,578 * 1.4 = ~12,000 tok/s**
Optimistic combined: **8,578 * 1.7 = ~14,500 tok/s**

This would match or beat vLLM (12,740) across the full batch range.

## Key Architectural Insight

The single largest remaining optimization is **CUDA graph capture/replay done correctly**. The broken implementation showed 10,291 tok/s (23% gain) but produced garbage because it replayed with stale block table pointers. A correct implementation must:

1. Pre-allocate persistent input buffers (token_ids, positions, block_tables, etc.)
2. Update buffer contents in-place before replay (memcpy, not re-allocate)
3. Only replay for decode steps with the same padded batch size
4. Never replay during prefill (variable sequence lengths)
5. Validate output coherency on every change

The graph infrastructure exists in `crates/gpt-oss-worker/src/graph_runner.rs`. The capture/replay pool with padded batch sizes {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32} is implemented. What broke was the metadata update path -- block tables and positions need to be updated in the captured graph's input buffers, not in newly allocated buffers.
