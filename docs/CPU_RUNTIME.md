# Native GPT-OSS CPU Runtime

The initial CPU runtime is intentionally narrow: Linux, batch size one,
official GPT-OSS SafeTensors, BF16 dense weights, and MXFP4 experts. It does
not route through the CUDA runner or the mock architecture.

## Weight ownership

`CpuTensorStore` maps every SafeTensors shard read-only and borrows dense
tensors directly from those mappings. It does not construct the existing
GPU-shaped `ModelWeights` collection. The snapshot must remain immutable for
the lifetime of the runner; Hugging Face content-addressed snapshot blobs meet
that requirement.

Only `gate_up_proj` and `down_proj` MXFP4 tensors are repacked. Cache keys cover
the resolved model revision, every source-shard SHA-256, the tensor name and
shape, repack format version, and layout version. A repacked record is the E8M0
scale byte followed by the 16 adjacent-nibble bytes for one 32-value block.
Writers use an exclusive lock, a synced temporary file, atomic rename, and a
directory sync. Published files are mapped read-only and never changed in
place.

## Numeric and cache behavior

- Dense BF16 and MXFP4 projections accumulate in FP32 and round at BF16 model
  operation boundaries.
- YaRN uses GPT-NeoX half rotation and the checkpoint's correction range and
  attention scale.
- GQA maps eight query heads to each KV head for the 20B checkpoint.
- Learned per-head sinks add a logit to the softmax denominator with an
  implicit zero value vector.
- Sliding layers retain exactly the latest 128 BF16 K/V tokens. Full-attention
  layers retain the configured CPU context cap.
- Routing is stable top-4-of-32 selected-logit softmax. Gate/up outputs use the
  official interleaved clamped GPT-OSS SwiGLU formula.

The runtime remains experimental until the separate 32 GiB i7 full-checkpoint,
cross-runtime, API, and memory gates are complete. Trusted mode must continue
to reject CPU serving until that evidence exists.
